    TMEASURES: Transformational Measures for Neural Networks - PyTorch Library
  img: tm_pytorch.png
  desc: >
    TMEASURES: A library to compute easily compute Transformation Measures for PyTorch Models. Tensorflow version in progress. The library provides various invariance and same-equivariance measures ready to be applied to any neural network model. The library also allows to easily implement new transformational measures in a straightforward and efficient manner.
