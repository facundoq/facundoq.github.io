- name: "ReTroH: Recovery of Historic Astronomical Observations"
  img: retroh.png
  desc: The Faculty of Astronomical and Geophysical Sciences (FCAG) of the National University of La Plata (UNLP) has a very rich history in astronomical, geophysical, and meteorological observations since its creation as the La Plata Observatory over a century ago. The institution has initiated a project to enhance the historical-scientific-cultural heritage through an interdisciplinary team. In this context, the ultimate goal of the ReTrOH project is to transfer knowledge through the recovery, digitization, and enhancement of old data.

- name: Detection of Be Stars and other astronomical objects

  desc: Astronomical databases currently provide high-volume spectroscopic and photometric data. In this work we evaluate the use of neural networks to identify Be star candidates from a set of OB-type stars. The networks are trained using a labeled subset of the VPHAS+ and 2MASS databases, with filters u, g, r, HÎ±, i, J, H, and K (photometric data).We propose and evaluate the use of reddening-free Q indices to enhance the generalization of the model to other databases and objects. Our results show that the proposed features provide a significant improvement over the original filter magnitudes.
