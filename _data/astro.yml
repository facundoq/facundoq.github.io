    PlateUNLP: AI-powered software to digitalize historic spectrogram plates - part of the ReTrOH.
  img: spectrogram.png
  desc: The goal of the ReTrOH project is to transfer knowledge through the recovery, digitization, and enhancement of historical data from the Faculty of Astronomical and Geophysical Sciences (FCAG) of the National University of La Plata (UNLP) through an interdisciplinary team. In this context, we developed an intelligent software to assist in the recovery of information contained in plates. The software includes a module that automatically detects spectra, streamlines the loading of metadata, and verifies its standardization. The use of the software will significantly reduce the required man-hours and processing errors.
