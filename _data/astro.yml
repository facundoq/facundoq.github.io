    SPECTROGRAM: AI-powered software to digitalize historic spectrogram plates.
  img: spectrogram.png
  desc: We present an intelligent software to assist in the recovery of information contained in plates. The software includes a module that automatically detects spectra, streamlines the loading of metadata, and verifies its standardization. The use of the software will significantly reduce the required man-hours and processing errors.
